I am a Ph.D. student in the Biophysics Graduate Group at the University of California, Berkeley, where I am advised by Professor Jennifer Listgarten, a member of the EECS Department and the Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research Lab. My work focuses on developing probabilistic methods for designing biological sequences.
